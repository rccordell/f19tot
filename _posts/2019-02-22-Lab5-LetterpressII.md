For today's lab you may write an open response. Be sure to incorporate our readingsâ€”especially those from 2/15 we have yet to discuss together. Use this lab report to think through those readings a bit further than you were able to during your class prep, with a particular eye toward how they intersect with your experience setting up your print job.
