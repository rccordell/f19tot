For this lab report I want you to consider Marian Evans' perspective—or, given our lab, perhaps Jane Austen's—on our work transforming literary texts into data. What kinds of uses might such transformation serve? What new interpretive possibility might be opened by thinking of literature as data, and what possibilities does such a view foreclose? And, because (shockingly!) I don't tend to think these dichotomies are necessary or helpful, how might machine and human reading work together to offer new perspectives on literature, history, or other humanistic texts?
