Today we'll be experimenting with [Twine](http://twinery.org/), "an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories." The term "non-linear" stories is a broad one, and so some folks think of Twine as a platform for making electronic literature, while others consider it a platform for making games (while others question that distinction). Twine was used most famously to map out the story for the ["Bandersnatch" episode](https://www.wired.com/story/black-mirror-bandersnatch-interactive-episode/) of *Black Mirror*. Next week we'll be looking at [a game](http://slimedaughter.com/games/twine/wtwla/) by the prominent [Twine developer Porpentine](http://slimedaughter.com/games/), and there are [many Twine games](https://itch.io/games/made-with-twine) out in the world for folks to play. 

You can use Twine online or download the application for your computer. Allison Parrish's [A Quick Twine (2.2+) Tutorial](http://catn.decontextualize.com/twine/) is a great introduction to the platform and some basic macros and variables that can extend the platform's capabilities. We will refer to it throughout today's class.

I've also prepared a basic [Twine interpretation of the first chapter of *Moby Dick*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ihhbqml4inayu0h/Loomings.html?dl=0), which you can open in your browser and view *or*, more usefully, import into Twine so you can see how it is set up. If you download the HTML file, you can use the "Import from file" option within Twine to investigate the story's structure. This is a pretty simple Twine structure, though I did try to build in a few macros that track, for instance, which pages a user has visited before allowing them to move on in the text.
