# Reading Responses

For each unit in this class, you will be assigned articles or books to read, files to watch, websites to browse, etc. In order to help you attend closely to our course texts and prepare for each class, you should prepare 3 questions or observations prior to each chapter of the class syllabus (in general, the Monday of each week, with marked exceptions). These reading responses will serve as prompts for our conversation and demonstrate your initial engagement with the ideas of our class. Your responses should be written down and ready to submit at the beginning of class. In order for your reading responses to be "Satisfactory," they should, in general:

1. Get beyond basic questions or observations of fact and instead work toward questions or observations of significance. 
2. Demonstrate close thought about the themes, style, arguments and other elements of our texts, as well as about the relationships among them. 
3. Emerge from (and refer to) specific ideas, pages, quotations, scenes, &c. from our assigned texts rather than broad or generic concepts.
4. Genuinely open toward discussion and debate during class (i.e. no leading the witness, your honor). 

Reading prep will be deemed "Unsatisfactory" when it indicates lack of preparation or inattentive reading, and will have consequences as outlined in your grading contract.
