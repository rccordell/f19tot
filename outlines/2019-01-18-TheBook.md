## Introductory

Consider the first section of *The Book* and Mak's "Architecture of the Page" (you may consult your class prep fieldbook entries) and find a word that speaks to your ideas or questions across the two readings. It may be a word in the readings or a word of your own choice that points to the readings in a meaningful way. Pick something you'll have something to say about in regards to both readings from this week. Once you've chosen your word and have an idea about what you want to say, write it on the board.
