# Using this Schedule

## Schedule Organization

Our syllabus is divided into thematic books and organized by weekly "chapters," each of which includes a set of required readings and (typically) a humanities laboratory we will complete together. Readings should be prepared (and the *class prep* for them committed to your [fieldbook](/assignments/fieldbook)) before class on the day of the assignment.

## A Key to Alerts

{% include alert alert='These red alert boxes signal a change of our typical schedule, such as meeting in a location outside the classroom or altered office hours during the week.' %}

{% include alert warning='These orange alert boxes signal an assignment due date.' %}

{% include alert info='These information boxes signal the in-class lab that we will work on together. As the semester progresses I will add links to the lab assignments to these boxes. Your fieldbook reports are due within a week of a given lab session.' %}
