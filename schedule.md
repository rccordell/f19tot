## A Note on the Schedule:

Each week there are readings listed under *Core* and *Penumbra*. The core readings are just that: central to the week's discussion and lab. Everyone should read these closely and prepare to discuss them. The penumbral readings include some of the many brilliant pertinent readings I could not require because time is, sadly, finite. Each week you should choose (at least) one of the penumbral readings, based on your own interests, to read closely and be prepared to discuss in class. 

In the week you lead class you should prepare all of the core and penumbral readings, and if you choose to dig into one of these topics for an assignment the penumbral readings are the first place you can start expanding your thinking.

## Accessing Readings

The majority of our readings will be available online or through [a digital course packet in Leganto](https://northeastern.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01NEU_INST/lists/8892775840001401?auth=SAML). The first time you wish to access items from Leganto you will need to log in through Blackboard (the only time we'll use it this semester), but thereafter the direct links in the schedule should work. If you switch to a new computer or device you may need to log in through Blackboard once.
