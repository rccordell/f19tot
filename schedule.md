# Using this Schedule

## Schedule Organization

With a few marked exceptions, the readings on the schedule below should be prepared (and the *class prep* for them committed to your [fieldbook](/assignments/fieldbook)) prior to the first class of their respective week, which is generally a Monday. 

Unless otherwise noted, each Wednesday we complete a humanities laboratory together. Labs are generally held in our regular classroom, but there will be a few times during the semester when we will meet in a place called out on the schedule.

## Accessing Readings

The majority of our readings will be available online or through [a digital course packet in Leganto](). The first time you wish to access items from Leganto you will need to log in through Blackboard (the only time we'll use it this semester), but thereafter the direct links in the schedule should work. If you switch to a new computer or device you may need to log in through Blackboard once.
